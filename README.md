Our CEO needs some in-depth research on our CGM patient payments. We're looking to get a clear picture of what's been billed and what's actually come in, especially since we haven't been billing patients yet this year.

Could you please put together an Excel sheet with the following information for each patient on the CGM Sheet?
_________________________
# Payment Details Needed Per Patient:
Date of Service (DOS): For each individual service date.

Amount Billed: What was originally billed for that DOS.

Insurance: Which insurance company was billed.

Amount Paid: How much was paid by insurance or the patient for that DOS.

Amount Denied: Any portion of the claim that was denied for that DOS.

Patient Responsibility: The amount the patient owes (if applicable) for that DOS.

__________________________________

Why We Need This:
This data is crucial for us to understand exactly what has gone out (billed) and what has come in (paid). Additionally, our CEO specifically wants to know what each patient technically owes us each month this year, considering we haven't sent out patient bills yet.

Thanks so much for your help!
